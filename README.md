In March 2018, I am learning the app development of the Microsoft HoloLens. I think the best way to learn a particular technology is to build something with it!
This app can capture what the user sees and then detect faces and display metadata about the identified person in the frame of the HoloLens' camera.

I build this app on top of the starter code which was automatically generated by Visual C# Holographic DirectX App Template

My goals for this project:
1. Get familiarized with interfacing the hardware and developing HoloLens app.
2. Manipulate camera stream and position the dynamic label in the scene.
3. Microsoft Azure's Face Cognitive service.
