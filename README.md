"# HolographicFaceTracking"

In March 2018, I am learning the app development of the Microsoft HoloLens. I think the best way to learn a particular technology is to build something with it!
This app can capture what the user sees and then detect faces in the frame of the HoloLens' camera.

I build this app on top of the starter code which was automatically generated by Visual C# Holographic DirectX App Template

My goals for this project:
1. Get familiarized with interfacing the hardware and developing HoloLens app.
2. Manipulate camera stream and position the dynamic label in the scene.
3. Microsoft Azure's Face Cognitive service.
